# Toy - A Total ordering Optimistic sYstem
## Introduction
### Abstract
Toy is a total ordering optimistic system targeting permissioned Blockchains. It assumes an optimal conditions and so amortized the 
the cost of handling failures among all rounds, creating a robust, scalable and highly efficient Blockchain platform.

### System Model
Toy assume a Byzantine partial synchronous environment in which the number of faulty nodes, _f_ is less then third of the nodes.
_Partial synchronous_ means that after an unknown time _t_ there is an unknown upper bound _k_ on the messages transfer delays.

### Related Work
Toy currently uses [bft-SMaRt](https://github.com/bft-smart/library) as an underlying platform to tolerate the non-optimistic scenarios  
### Papers
This work is an implementation of the TOY algorithm described in TBA

## Getting Started
### Installation (for Ubuntu)
1. Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
    * `sudo apt install maven` 
1. Download the project:
    * `git pull https://github.com/NugasDSL/toy.git`
    * Or via this [link](https://github.com/NugasDSL/toy/archive/master.zip)
1. Go to the project directory and run:
    * `mvn package`
1. `lib/toy-core-1.0.jar` will be created under the project directory
1. You may now use this jar to create a _Toy_ server

### Configurations
An example configuration can be found under `conf/`
#### bft-SMaRt Configuration
Toy uses bft-SMaRt as an underlying platform in three different modules (_bbc_, _panic_ and _sync_). Hence, Toy configuration should include
three different configuration directories - each one for each module. `conf/bbc`, `conf/panic` and `conf/sync` are samples for
such configurations with a single node.

Deeper explanation of bft-SMaRt configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/bft-smart/library/wiki/BFT-SMaRt-Configuration)
#### Toy Configuration
Toy configuration is consist of a single `config.toml` file that describes Toy's settings as well as the paths to bft-SMaRt's configurations.

More about Toy's configuration can be found in the WiKi [citeciteicite]

### Example
We now expline the example provaided in `src/main/java/toy/examples`. The example establishes a simple client/server Blockchain application 
using Toy library.

The server is implemented in `ServerApp.java` and uses gRPC for client\server communication. We already built an IDL in 
`src/main/java/protos` but you may implement your own IDL.
